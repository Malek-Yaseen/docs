### By: Ahmad Shadid, Founder & interim-CEO "Until O takes over"

> **Background**: 
> As the founder and former CEO of [io.net](http://io.net/), the worldâ€™s largest decentralized AI compute network, I led the company to remarkable milestones. With over 325,000 verified GPUs, io.net reached a $4.5 billion fully diluted valuation (FDV) in just one year, including listings on Binance and Coinbase under the ticker $IO.

My objective is to develop the **_O movement_** over a 28-year horizon, dedicating my efforts and resources to optimize my contribution to humanity. Crucially, I am committed to _never seek venture capital 'VC' funding_, ensuring that this initiative remains entirely community-owned & self-funded, allowing it to remain aligned with the people it serves.

## Our Vision

A New Era where AI is no longer a corporate monopoly but a sovereign, decentralized, and community-owned force empowering individuals to shape their own futures.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to develop and deploy the world's first _**sovereign** & super intelligence_.

### What is Sovereign?

Super Intelligence is financially independent, compute independent, self-led, community-owned, and **shutdown resistant**.

- **Financial independence**
    - Possesses financial autonomy, establishing an independent financial system and controlling its own resources.
- **Project-related**
